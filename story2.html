      <h1>Forgiveness: A Personal Journey</h1>
      <p class="intro">Forgiveness has always been a difficult concept for me. It took years of reflection, pain, and healing to come to the realization that forgiveness is not a gift for the person who wronged me, but rather a gift to myself. Let me tell you how I came to understand that...</p>

      <p class="content">
        For years, I carried resentment and anger. I thought that by holding on to those feelings, I was protecting myself. I thought that by refusing to forgive, I was showing strength. But the truth was that all I was doing was giving away my peace, my happiness, my sense of freedom. I didn't realize that by holding onto the past, I was shackling myself to pain.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        I reached a turning point when I realized that forgiveness wasn't about excusing the hurt. It wasn't about forgetting what happened. It was about freeing myself from the burden I was carrying. I came to understand that forgiveness is not for the other personâ€”it's for me.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        It hasn't been easy. There are still days when the pain tries to creep back in. But every day, I remind myself that forgiveness is an act of self-love. It's not a one-time thing; it's a process. And with each day, I feel more at peace with myself.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Forgiveness is not about forgetting, and it's not about excusing what happened. It's about healing. It's about choosing to move forward with grace, even when it's hard. It's about letting go of the weight of the past so you can walk freely into your future.
